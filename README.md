# 👋 Hi, I’m **Caroline Uriarte**  
_(GitHub handle: `carolineuriarte18-maker`)_  

Passionate **Software Developer** and **Machine Learning Enthusiast** from the Philippines (Davao).  
I build meaningful projects — from Flutter UI components to frog-species classifiers — that solve real-world problems and flex my creative + technical muscle.

## 🎨 My Signature Palette  
Here’s a vibe I like:  

- ![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/000000.png) `#000000` — **Black**  
- ![#8B4513](https://via.placeholder.com/15/8B4513/8B4513.png) `#8B4513` — **SaddleBrown**  
- ![#FFFFFF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FFFFFF/FFFFFF.png) `#FFFFFF` — **White**

This palette reflects sophistication (black), grounded energy (brown), and clarity (white) — which resonate in how I code and design.

## 🔭 What I’m Working On

- Polishing **Flutter UI Component libraries** to speed up UI development  
- Advancing my **bioacoustic / image-based ML research** — especially with frog species classification  
- Deploying ML models to the edge using **TensorFlow Lite**  
- Exploring **MLOps**, **CI/CD**, and clean architecture in my projects
