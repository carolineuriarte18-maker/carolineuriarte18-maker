# 👋 Hi, I'm Caroline Uriarte (a.k.a. **carolineuriarte18-maker**)

Welcome to my GitHub 👩‍💻  
I’m a passionate **Software Developer & Machine Learning Enthusiast** based in the Philippines (Davao). I love building things that solve real-world problems — from AI-powered classification systems to web apps and more.

---

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

- Building and refining ML pipelines — currently focused on **bioacoustic classification** (like frogs 🐸)  
- Exploring **edge deployment**: optimizing models with TensorFlow Lite  
- Growing my **portfolio** with more full-stack and data-driven projects  
- Learning more about **MLOps**, **cloud-native architecture**, and **CI/CD**

## 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are some projects I’m particularly proud of:

- **Alvarez Frogs Classification** – A complete pipeline (preprocessing, training, inference) for classifying frog species via audio/image data  
- **[Project-X Name]** – Description: what it does, why it's cool  
- **[Project-Y Name]** – Description: tech stack, impact, what I learned  

_(Feel free to update these with links, screenshots, or short GIF demos to make them more engaging)_

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Dive deeper into **deep learning architectures** (CNNs, Transformers, etc.)  
- Study **edge inference** and optimization for real-time deployment  
- Master **MLOps practices**: versioning, monitoring, CI/CD for ML  
- Explore **open-source contributions** — I want to actively contribute to ML / data science libraries  

---

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate

I’m always open to:

- Open-source contributions & project ideas  
- Learning opportunities & mentorship  
- Teaming up with others on ML / data-science / web projects  
- Tech talks, hackathons, or research collaborations
